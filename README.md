# Frogger_REWORK
<small> Reworked the Frogger-Clone repository. </small><br>
<small> After going back and viewing the old code I noticed I could have shortened up some of the collision and some of the spawning objects on the screen. </small><br>
<small>Created a new PlayerHit class with two functions that control some of the collision and scoring. </small><br>
<small>Reduced the amount of classes I had initially for the vehicles down to just one class that controls all vehicles.</small><br>
<small>Reduced the amount of grass object classes I had aswell down to just one class for all grass objects (located at the top of the program). </small><br>
<small>Renamed most of the static variables and functions to follow the standard Python naming style.</small><br>
<small>Created in Python by Brandyn Watkins</small>
