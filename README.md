# Frogger_REWORK
<small> Reworked the Frogger-Clone repository. </small>
<small> After going back and viewing the old code I noticed I could have shortened up some of the collision and some of the spawning objects on the screen. </small>
<small>Created a new PlayerHit function that controls some of the collision and scoring. </small>
<small>Reduced the amount of classes I had initially for the vehicles down to just one class that controls all vehicles.</small>
<small>Reduced the amount of grass object classes I had aswell down to just one class for all grass objects(located at the top of the program). </small>
