## How to run this project:
* Must have Python and Pygame installed on your machine.
* Create a clone of this repository.
* You then should be able to run the main.py file inside of folder Frogger REWORK.

## I also uploaded this project onto itch.io (website for indie game developers)
* Made the project into an executable with pyinstaller (still requires you to have Python/Pygame installed on your machine).
* Here is a link to the project on my itch.io profile [click here](https://jelybeenz.itch.io/frogger) :point_left:

### About this project:
* This was one of my first projects ever made with Python using Pygame library.
* Learned about using while loops for games, collision detection, classes, functions, for loops, rendering images.
